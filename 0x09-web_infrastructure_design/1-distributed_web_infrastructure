To design a three-server web infrastructure for hosting the website www.foobar.com, we can follow these specifications:

1. User Access:
   - When a user wants to access the website, they enter the URL www.foobar.com in their web browser.

2. Server:
   - We will have three servers that will handle different components of the web infrastructure.
   - The servers will be named Server1, Server2, and Server3.

3. Domain Name:
   - The domain name (foobar.com) is the unique address used to identify the website.
   - The www record is a DNS (Domain Name System) record that points the domain name to the load balancer's IP address.

4. DNS Record:
   - The www record in www.foobar.com is a subdomain that specifies the load balancer to handle requests for the website.
   - It is typically associated with the load balancer component of the infrastructure.

5. Load Balancer (HAproxy):
   - The load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to improve performance and ensure high availability.
   - It is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm, which works by rotating requests among the available servers in a circular order.

6. Web Server (Nginx):
   - The web server (Nginx) is responsible for receiving and processing HTTP requests from users.
   - It serves static files and routes dynamic requests to the application server.

7. Application Server:
   - The application server handles dynamic content generation and business logic of the website.
   - It receives requests from the web server, processes them, and generates responses to be sent back to the user.

8. Application Files:
   - The application files contain the code base of the website.
   - They include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any server-side code required for the website's functionality.

9. Database (MySQL):
   - The database stores and manages the website's data.
   - We will configure a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster for high availability and data redundancy.

10. Primary-Replica Cluster:
    - The Primary-Replica cluster consists of one Primary node and one or more Replica nodes.
    - The Primary node handles all write operations and replicates data changes to the Replica nodes.
    - The Replica nodes handle read operations and can take over as the Primary node in case of a failover event.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
   - The load balancer is a potential SPOF since it handles all incoming requests.
   - To mitigate this, redundancy measures like adding backup load balancers or implementing DNS round-robin can be considered.

2. Security Issues:
   - There is no firewall or HTTPS encryption in this infrastructure, which can leave it vulnerable to attacks.
   - Adding a firewall and enabling HTTPS can improve security.

3. No Monitoring:
   - There is no monitoring system in place to track server performance or detect issues.
   - Adding a monitoring system can help identify and resolve  issues before they cause downtime.

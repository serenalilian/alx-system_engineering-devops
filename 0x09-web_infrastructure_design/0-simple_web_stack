# ANSWERS
1. A server is a computer system that stores and delivers web content to users over the internet.
In this case, we have one server that will handle all the components of the web infrastructure.

2. Role of a Domain 
  The domain name (foobar.com) is the unique address used to identify the website.
The www record is a DNS (Domain Name System) record that points the domain name to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

3. DNS record
 The www record in www.foobar.com is a subdomain that specifies the server to handle requests for the website.
It is typically associated with the web server component of the infrastructure.

4. Web Server
 The web server (Nginx) is responsible for receiving and processing HTTP requests from users.
It serves static files and routes dynamic requests to the application server.

5. Application Server
 The application server handles dynamic content generation and business logic of the website.
It receives requests from the web server, processes them, and generates responses to be sent back to the user.

6. Aplication Files
  The application files contain the code base of the website.
They include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any server-side code required for the website's functionality

7. Database My SQL
  The database stores and manages the website's data.
MySQL is a popular relational database management system used in this infrastructure.

8.USer
  The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP protocol.
The user's computer sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested content.

## Issues with this Infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since there is only one server, if it fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
To mitigate this, redundancy measures like adding backup servers or implementing load balancing can be considered.

2. Downtime during Maintenance:
When deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, resulting in downtime.
To minimize downtime, strategies like rolling deployments or using multiple servers can be implemented. 

3. Limited Scalability:
 With only one server, the infrastructure cannot handle a large influx of incoming traffic.
Scaling options like adding more servers, load balancers, or utilizing cloud-based infrastructure can address this limitation
